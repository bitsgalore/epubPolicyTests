# EPUB KB policy testing

## Contents of this repository

A set of *EPUB* test files, specifically created for the purpose of testing an automated procedure to validate *EPUB*s  against KB institutional policies. These policies require the following:

* Files must be valid *EPUB* (version 2 or 3)
* File may not contain DRM or encryption (edge case: font mangling, should be permitted)
* All resources in the container fall within the Core Media Types 
* No Digital Talking Book (DTB) content documents

As a result, most of the files in this repo deliberately violate one or more of the above requirements. 

Some of the files were newly created (with a little help from [Sigil](http://sigil-ebook.com/)), whereas others were taken or adapted from other openly-licensed data sets. 

## Directories

* **content** - uncompressed contents of each test file (each subdirectory represents one epub)
* **build** - actual epub builds
* **pubresources** - various resources (files) that were used for creating the epubs.

## Main script

The script *buildepubs.sh* iterates over all subdirectories in the *content* folder and compresses the contents of each to a functional *epub* file in the *build* directory.

For an explanation of how the build process works, see [here](https://gist.github.com/bitsgalore/da04413787931d20a8bf).

## Description of test files

|File name|Epub version|Description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|epub20_minimal.epub|2|Basic file with one text resource and one image|
|epub20_minimal_encryption.epub|2|Includes encryption.xml resource in `META-INF`, indicating that main text resource is encrypted (text resource is not *actually* encrypted, BTW)|
|epub30_font_obfuscation.epub|3|Includes fonts that are obfuscated (which results in *hasEncryption* in epubcheck). Taken from [EPUB 3 Sample Documents](https://code.google.com/p/epub-samples/) ([*wasteland with OTF fonts, obfuscated*](https://code.google.com/p/epub-samples/downloads/detail?name=wasteland-otf-obf-20120118.epub&can=2&q=)).|
|epub20_not_core_media_type.epub|2|Includes JP2 image, which is a format that is not on the list of Core Media Types|

## Core Media Types in *EPUB* 2 and *3*

Most of the *EPUB* 3 Core Media Types are also supported by *EPUB* 2, with the exception of fonts (*OpenType* and *WOFF*), Media Overlay Documents, Text-to-Speech Overlay documents, *MP3* and *AAC LC* Audio and scripts. In addition, for Content Documents *EPUB* 2 allows the use of the *Digital Talking Book* format (DTBook) as an alternative to *XHTML1.1*. This is no longer the case in *EPUB* 3. However, Section 2.2 (Reading System Conformance) of *EPUB Publications* states that 

> [a]n EPUB Reading System (...) *should* process EPUB version 2 Publications (...)

## Detection of Digital Talking Book content documents

From <http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPS_2.0.1_draft.htm#TOC1.4.1.1>:

> A document is considered an OPS Content Document if and only if:
>
>   i. it uses a combination of the XHTML subset defined in this document and OPS-specific content extensions such as Inline XML Islands and Inline SVG; or
>   ii. it is a document with the MIME media type application/x-dtbook+xml which conforms to the DTB specification (http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-86-2005.html) and must not use OPS-specific content extensions such as Inline XML Islands or Inline SVG; or
>   iii. it is an XML document of any other MIME media type and is thus an Out-Of-Line XML Island
